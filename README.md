# Skip-gram Word2Vec

**NOTE:** This project is an optional excercise from Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.

PyTorch implementation of Word2Vec algorithm using the Skip-gram architecture. The main  porpuse of this project is for me to learn about embedding words for use in Natural Language Processing.

## Readings

* [Conceptual overview](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) of Word2Vec from Chris McCormick 
* [First Word2Vec paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) from Mikolov et al.
* [Neural Information Processing Systems, paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) with improvements for Word2Vec also from Mikolov et al.
